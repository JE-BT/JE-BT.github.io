My name is Jason and I am a PhD candidate at Nord University and assistant professor in geography and GIS. I also reasearch development and risk, and study how geography helps to shape our individual identity and understanding of place. I have a degree in Globalization and Sustainable Development from NTNU in Trondheim and moved to Norway from Edmonton, Canada in 2021. My family lives in the western part of the United States and migrated from Malmö over a century ago. I have studied and worked in many different countries, including the US, Canada, Norway, and New Zealand. My understanding of place has been shaped by the many places I have lived, my ancestry and cultural heritage, my own personal history reflected through my full name, Jason Eric Bunderson Toler, and my research. I live with my husband and our two Siberian Huskies in Bodø, Norway. 

## Current Projects and Groups:

- PhD in Social Science with a focus on Arctic Vulernabilities (Nord University)
- Nord Arctic and the Geo Security research group at Nord University
- Scenario Analyses Regarding Climate-Change Hazards and Critical Infrastructure in the Arctic (CCCI) at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute in Oslo
